This repository covers basic to advanced use of NVIDIA's tools to create a Conversational AI model.

Think of Alexa </br>
Through the use of NVIDIA's ` NGC GPU` I was able to create and deploy a Conversational AI model </br>
I opted to use 'tao' instead of `NeMO`
To learn more about NVIDIA's `Nemo` and `tao` follow this [link](nvidia.com) </br>
We will also take advantage of `ASR`
